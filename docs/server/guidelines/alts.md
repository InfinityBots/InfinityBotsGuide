title: Alternate Accounts
---
Generally speaking, having multiple accounts (commonly referred to as alts) on this server is frowned upon. 
While not completely against the rules, sometimes you want to be anonymous and want to lurk without drawing attention. 
So long as your alt does not disrupt the decorum and general atmosphere of the server, you may have multiple accounts here. 
However, if the mods believe you are using an alt to circumvent a block, exceed vote count requirements or to harass users, the mods have full discretion to take mod action against all accounts that they reasonably believe belong to you, up to and including a ban.
