  4. Block any essential features, this includes buttons and advertisements 
  5. Use any of the provided buttons to link to unrelated content

## Requirements
All bots listed on or added to our website should respect the following guidelines: 
  1. Abide by Infinity Bots [Terms of Service](https://infinitybotlist.com/terms), Discordâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), [API Rate Limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) and [Developer Terms](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal). 
  2. Must be online during review, public and invitable
  3. The main feature and majority of the commands must work
  4. Keep NSFW content (including, but not limited: links that source to pornographic material) inside of NSFW channels
  5. May not include any seizure-inducing content (gifs, emojis)
  6. Commands must only require permissions that the command being run needs. (e.g the kick command can only require the kick permission as it's required to be used). Bots cannot require the administrator permission for it to work.
